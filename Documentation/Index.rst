The Feed Display Extension provides an Extbase based frontend plugin to
fetch and parse RSS and Atom web feeds to be displayed in the frontend
by Fluid.

It allows you to configure which data should be scraped and made
available in Fluid as variables. Configuration can be done globally by
TypoScript or directly in the plugin options.
